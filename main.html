	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science, analyzing the efficiency of algorithms by evaluating the amount of time they require to execute as a function of the size of their input. It serves as a yardstick for gauging how efficiently an algorithm performs as the input size increases. By quantifying the relationship between input size and execution time, time complexity enables us to compare algorithms and identify the most efficient ones for solving specific problems. This analysis, typically expressed using big O notation, provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time relative to the size of its input. By understanding time complexity, developers can make informed decisions about algorithm selection, anticipating how different algorithms will scale with increasing input sizes and ultimately optimizing computational resources for efficient problem-solving.</p>
	<p>Time complexity, as pivotal as it is, is complemented by another critical metric in algorithm analysis: <b>Space Complexity</b>. While time complexity measures the efficiency of algorithms in terms of their runtime, space complexity assesses their memory usage. It evaluates how the amount of memory required by an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. Similar to time complexity, space complexity is often expressed using big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Algorithms with O(n) space complexity require memory proportional to the size of the input. Analyzing space complexity is crucial for optimizing memory usage, especially in scenarios where memory resources are limited, such as embedded systems or environments with constrained memory. By understanding both time and space complexity, developers can design and implement algorithms that are not only efficient in terms of runtime but also mindful of memory usage, ensuring optimal performance across various computational environments.</p>
